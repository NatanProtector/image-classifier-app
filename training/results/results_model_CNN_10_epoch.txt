Cat accuracy: 0.6499466300010681
Dog accuracy: 0.28441834449768066
Other accuracy: 0.9502487778663635

conclusion:
recognizing an other and dog and cat is too general with the current architecture
the model just claims eveything is an other
Idea:
Create and IsCat model, and a IsDog model
might be easier to Create
and claim is not dog and not cat then it is an other
